cd META-MANSION. 
```
## Install Dependencies
```bash
npm install ethers@5.7.2
npm install --save-dev hardhat
```
## Run Tests
```bash
npx hardhat test
```
## Start Hardhat Node
```bash
npx hardhat node
```
## Deploy Smart Contracts
```bash
npx hardhat run ./scripts/deploy.js --network localhost
```
## Connect the Wallet

## Start Frontend
```bash
npm run start
```
## üìù Project Details

- **NFT Creation**: Property listings are minted as NFTs on the Ethereum blockchain, allowing for secure ownership transfers.
- **IPFS Storage**: Property data (JSON format) is stored using IPFS to ensure decentralized and secure listings.
- **React Frontend**: An intuitive and interactive frontend using **React.js** for a smooth user experience.
- **Testing with Fake Ethers**: Simulated accounts with 1000 ethers each for testing real-world scenarios in a sandbox environment.

## Connect wallets
 To connect the wallet you have to join the personal network 
 -1. add the network manually
  give network name
  rpc url when u start the node it will show a link  http://127.0.0.1:8545/ like this
  chain id is - 31337
  currency symbol can be anything..

 -2. after adding it go again in network and choose the network you add it will show the property.
 -3. go on account and add the account, and then import the accout with the private key your code has given in cmd.

 Here you go now the buy can be appear as the escrow contract and real estate address is recognized.
## üí° How It Works

- **Property Listings**: Users can list their properties by uploading details through the frontend. Data is stored securely using IPFS.
- **Buying/Selling Properties**: Properties are minted as NFTs, and ownership can be transferred between wallets using the smart contract.
- **Agent Contract**: A dedicated agent contract is included to manage property sales and ensure transparency in the transaction process.
